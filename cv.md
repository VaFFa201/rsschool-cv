## About myself:
I have no bad habits, I do sports. I like to cook, I periodically spend time playing computer games. I want to become a Front-End developer.

## Code example:

```
function nicknameGenerator(name){
  if(name.length < 4)
    return "Error: Name too short";
  if(/[aeiou]/i.test(name[2]))
    return name.substr(0, 4)
  return name.substr(0, 3)
}
```

## Work experience:
I did a couple of assignments at the university related to website development. *It didn't work out very well, but it was interesting.*
